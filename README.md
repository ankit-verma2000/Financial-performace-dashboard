## 📝 Problem Statement

__The company is generating strong sales revenue but struggling with low profit margins due to high operating costs and uneven segment performance.
Leadership required a comprehensive financial dashboard to:__

✏ Track sales, profit, and margins across different dimensions (segment, geography, product, and time).

✏ Identify loss-making areas and growth opportunities.

✏ Provide data-driven insights for strategic decisions.

## 🔑 Key Insights

1️⃣ Overall Performance

- Total Sales: $117.87M
- Total Profit: $16.89M
- Profit Margin: 14.33% (low, due to high COGS at $100.98M).

2️⃣ By Segment

- Government: Highest sales ($52.5M) but modest margin (21.6%).
- Channel Partners: Small revenue ($1.8M) but excellent margin (73%).
- Enterprise: Loss-making (-$0.6M).
- Small Business: Strong sales ($42.4M) but negligible margin (<1%).

3️⃣ By Geography

- The USA & Canada dominate (≈approximately 43% of sales), indicating an over-reliance on two markets.
- Europe (France, Germany) and Mexico show untapped growth potential.

4️⃣ By Product

- Amarilla (18.73%) and Paseo (17.35%) are the most profitable products.
- Velo (14.82%) and Carretera (15.5%) are below average.

5️⃣ Time Trends

- Strong seasonality, with peak months in September–October.
- Weak months in Jan–Feb, requiring demand-boosting strategies.


## ✅ Recommendations

- Scale profitable channels (Channel Partners) and fix loss-making segments (Enterprise, Small Business).
- Reduce COGS via supplier negotiations and operational efficiencies.
- Prioritise high-margin products (Amarilla, Paseo) in marketing campaigns.
- Expand into Europe & emerging markets to reduce dependency on the USA/Canada.
- Apply forecasting models to prepare for seasonal dips and optimise promotions.
